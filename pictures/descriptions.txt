Diagram Descriptions:

1. Semantic Network (semantic_network.png):
This diagram represents the conceptual relationships between clothing items, categories, and styles using nodes and labeled edges. 
It shows how an item like a 'White Tee' is-a 'Top' and acts as a visual map of the 'knowledge' the AI uses to understand garment compatibility.

2. Frame Representation (frame_representation.png):
This diagram illustrates the data structure of the wardrobe items, showing a 'Generic Frame' for clothing and specific 'Instance Frames' for individual pieces.
Each frame contains 'Slots' (like Type, Color, and Style) filled with 'Values', which is exactly how the wardrobe.js data is organized for the AI reasoning engine.
